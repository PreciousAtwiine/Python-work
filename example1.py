#Rules that govern the naming of variables in python
# a name given to a partition through programming is called a variable
num1=65 #num1 is a variable
num2=100 #num2 is a variable
print(num1)
print(num1 + num2)
#the name of the variable should not start with a numero eg. 1num or 10num
#a variable name should not start with a special character eg. @num,#num,!num
#compound variable names should not have spaces eg.num 1,num 2
#compound variable names should be joined by either an underscore or a camel case eg. num_1,num_2 or num1,num2
#avoid using capital letters to begin the name of a variable eg. Num1,Num2
#don't use special words as variable names eg. print,for,while,if,else,elif,import,def,class,return,pass
#python is case sensitive eg. Num1 is different from num1
# A complete instruction to a computer is called a statement(lines 3,4,5,6)
# A statement that evaluates to a result is called an expression e.g.line6
# A python file is called a python script
#A group of statements is called a code
#A group of related code is called a block
#A block of code in a python script is called a program
#The running/implementing of a program is called execution
#The process of creating a variable is declaring a variable
#the process of storing a value in a variable is called initializing/assigning a variable
# In python,where you find a variable that has more than one value in one single memory location is called a list and is identified using square brackets.
